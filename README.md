# DREAM-FLUTE Model for Commonsense Reasoning and Figurative Language Understanding

The DREAM-FLUTE project extends the capabilities of the DREAM model by integrating it with T5-BASE and BERT models, aiming to enhance performance on the Commonsense QA task. This repository contains the implementation code and related materials for the DREAM-FLUTE method which includes fine-tuning BERT on the CoS-E dataset and utilizing the DREAM model to generate detailed elaborations that improve the prediction precision of T5-BASE.

**Project Overview**
- Objective: Enhance commonsense reasoning and figurative language understanding in NLP models.
- Methods: Integration of DREAM with T5-BASE and BERT for better performance on the Commonsense QA task.
- Dataset: Uses the CoS-E dataset with comprehensive annotations for training and evaluation.
